## Hi I'm Pelumi!
Bio: This portfolio provides a technical deep dive into my work in threat detection and network security. It features end-to-end projects involving SIEM implementation (ELK/Splunk), firewall configuration (pfSense), and vulnerability management. Each repository contains detailed documentation of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques simulated, the investigative steps taken during triage, and the remediation strategies implemented. By combining technical proficiency in Kali Linux and PowerShell with a disciplined approach to risk management, I build and defend resilient virtual environments that mirror enterprise-level security challenges
